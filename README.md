# 🦠 Coronavirus-Data-Analysis
This project explores COVID-19 case trends using a multi-step data analysis pipeline involving Excel, SQL, and Tableau. The aim is to extract and clean case data, perform analytical queries, and visualize key trends and patterns in a clear, interactive dashboard.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Data Source**: COVID-19 case data was gathered from Our World in Data – COVID-19 dataset, which provides regularly updated global statistics on infections, deaths, testing, and more.
- **Tools Used**:  
  - **Excel**: For initial data extraction, cleaning, transformation, and preparation.
  - **SQL**: For querying cleaned data, calculating statistics, and answering specific analytical questions.
  - **Tableau**: For creating an interactive dashboard that showcases insights with visual clarity.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Clean and structure the raw dataset to prepare it for analysis.
- Use SQL queries to uncover insights, such as:
  - Case growth over time across regions or countries
  - Highest and lowest case rates by population
  - Recovery and death trends by region
- Visualize results using Tableau for clear communication and exploration.

## 🔍 Key Features

- Step-by-step data workflow: From raw data to clean visual insights
- SQL-powered analysis: Efficient queries for slicing and summarizing data
- Interactive dashboard: Built in Tableau for dynamic data exploration
- Metrics analyzed:
  - Total and new cases per day
  - Death and recovery rates
